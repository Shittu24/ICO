# Initial Coin Offering(ICO) For Crypto Devs WITH LEARNWEB3DAO SOPHOMORE TRACK

This project demonstrates an ICO contract where all our NFT holders gets 10 tokens per NFTs owned, then they can buy more tokens 
and also other people that don't own our NFTs can buy the tokens for ETH.

The frontend of this contract was built with NextJS that provides a simple user interface to allow users to interact with the contract.
Firstly, you need to connect your wallet and if you own Crypto Devs NFTs, you can claim tokens based on the ampount of NFTs your wallet address minted and then you can decide to buy more tokens for ETH. Also, users that dont have NFTs can click on the mint tokens button to buy the tokens at 0.001 ETH per token.
